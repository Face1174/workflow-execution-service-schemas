Use cases for Workflow Execution Schema

* Federated computing: a researcher can submit an analysis workflow to run on a dataset owned by an external organization, instead of having to make a copy ("bring your own code")
* Web app integration: a web based user interface to a specific workflow can use WES to submit to workflow execution service ("bring your own data")
* Workflow interoperability: workflows written in different languages or running on different clusters can programmatically invoke one another
