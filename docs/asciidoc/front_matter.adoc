== Executive Summary

The Workflow Execution Service (WES) API provides a standard way for users to submit workflow requests to workflow execution systems, and to monitor their execution. This API lets users run a single https://www.commonwl.org/[CWL] or http://www.openwdl.org/[WDL] workflow (other types may be supported in the future) on multiple different platforms, clouds, and environments.

Key features of the API:

* can request that a workflow be run
* can pass parameters to that workflow (e.g. input files, cmdline arguments)
* can get information about running workflows (e.g. status, errors, output file locations)
* can cancel a running workflow

== Authorization & Authentication

Users must supply credentials that establish their identity and authorization in order to use a WES endpoint. We recommend that WES implementations use an OAuth2 https://oauth.net/2/bearer-tokens/[bearer token], although they can choose other mechanisms if appropriate. WES callers can use the `auth_instructions_url` from the https://ga4gh.github.io/workflow-execution-service-schemas/#/WorkflowExecutionService/GetServiceInfo[service-info endpoint] to learn how to obtain and use a bearer token for a particular implementation.

The WES implementation is responsible for checking that a user is authorized to submit workflow run requests. The particular authorization policy is up to the WES implementer.
